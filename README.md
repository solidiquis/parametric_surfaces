# Parametric Surfaces in the Browser

Wanted to experiment with WebGL using the Rust + WASM toolchain, with React and TypeScript to glue everything together. I had planned on adding many more parametric surfaces to display, but at some point I realized two things:
1. There's a lot of boilerplate that I got tired of writing repeatedly for every single surface.
2. My graphics skills are pretty mediocre.

Because of those aforementioned points, I'm going to stop building on this project for the time being in order to continue my graphics studies, as well as work on my own 3D library that wraps around WebGL using Rust + WASM.
